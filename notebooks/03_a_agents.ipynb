    "### 1. Introduction to SK Agents\n",
    "Agents in Semantic Kernel are AI-powered entities that can engage in conversations, make decisions, and execute tasks. They can work independently or collaborate in groups to achieve complex goals.\n",

    "### 6. Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Design**\n",
    "   - Give clear, specific instructions\n",
    "   - Define scope and limitations\n",
    "   - Include example interactions\n",
    "   - Specify output formats\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Group Dynamics**\n",
    "   - Assign distinct roles\n",
    "   - Define clear interaction patterns\n",
    "   - Implement proper termination conditions\n",
    "   - Handle disagreements\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def safe_agent_invoke(agent: ChatCompletionAgent, chat: ChatHistory):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        async for response in agent.invoke_stream(chat):\n",
    "            yield response\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        yield f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n",
    "        chat.add_system_message(\"Error occurred during processing\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance**\n",
    "   - Limit maximum iterations\n",
    "   - Use streaming for long responses\n",
    "   - Implement timeouts\n",
    "   - Cache frequently used results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Advanced Use Cases\n",
